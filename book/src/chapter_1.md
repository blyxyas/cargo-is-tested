# Chapter 1: Introduction

This is a **Work-in-progress** book, not everything is documented.

`is_tested` is a ecosystem of crates aimed at making your testing easier to follow and check certain quality.

The ecosystem is formed by these 3 crates:

* **[`cargo-is-tested`]:** The binary
* **[`is_tested`]:** The attribute
* **[`is_not_tested`]**: Another attribute (*Optional*)

We'll take a look at each one of these crates, explain the purpose, the usage, the installation, and everything related to them.

Starting with the binary and the most complex part of the project, `cargo-is-tested`. In the next page.
